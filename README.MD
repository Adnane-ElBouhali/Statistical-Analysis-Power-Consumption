# Statistical Analysis of French Power Consumption

## Project Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project completed as part of the MDI220 - Statistics course at Télécom Paris. The project applies fundamental statistical concepts to analyze electrical power consumption data across various regions in France from 2013 to 2023.

## Course Context
MDI220 - Statistics is a second-year course at Télécom Paris that provides essential tools for practicing statistics and data analysis. The course covers fundamental concepts including:

- Statistical models
- Estimators
- Point estimation (maximum likelihood, method of moments)
- Quadratic risk
- Cramer-Rao bound
- Decision procedures
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence intervals
- Bayesian methods

## Project Description
This mini-project focuses on applying these statistical concepts to real-world data. Key aspects of the project include:

1. **Data**: Daily electricity consumption (in MW) for different regions in France from 2013 to 2023.
2. **Point Estimation**: Estimating mean and variance of consumption data.
3. **Goodness of Fit**: Assessing the appropriateness of Gaussian distribution models.
4. **Bayesian Statistics**: Incorporating prior knowledge into estimation.
5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Testing hypotheses about consumption patterns.
6. **Independence Testing**: Analyzing independence between regions' consumption.
7. **Confidence Intervals**: Constructing and interpreting confidence intervals for mean consumption.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- Seaborn

## Repository Structure
- `ELBOUHALI_ADNANE_projet_MDI220.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
- `power_consumption.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed
3. Place the `power_consumption.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook
4. Open and run the Jupyter notebook

## Note
This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates the application of statistical concepts learned in the MDI220 course at Télécom Paris.
